            <h1>Subject: Something I Need to Say
            </h1>
            <p>Hi Aska, I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been thinking about reaching out for a while, especially now since you’ve blocked me on Snapchat, TikTok, and removed me from Instagram. This feels like my last way to get in touch, and I hope you’ll hear me out.</p>
            <p>Over the past three months, since we started talking, I’ve felt like there’s always been this distance between us. There were moments where I tried to connect, but your responses often made me second-guess myself. I remember that one time you called me "weird," and I didn’t know how to respond to that. Other times, you reacted to my messages with a thumbs-up—something that felt like being left on "seen" without an actual reply. And of course, there were the times you actually left me on "seen."</p>
            <p>It’s been confusing for me because I wasn’t sure where I stood with you. Today, I made a sarcastic comment about how you could block or remove me if that’s what you wanted, and you actually did. I didn’t mean for it to come across that way—it was just me trying to express my frustration, and I realize now that it might have upset you. If I said or did anything to make you feel uncomfortable, I want to sincerely apologize.</p>
            <p>Even with all that’s happened, I still feel like I wanted to ask you something. Valentine’s Day is coming up, and I was wondering if you’d be my Valentine on the 14th. I know this might be unexpected, and maybe it’s too late, but I wanted to take a chance and ask.
            </p>
            <p>No matter what your answer is, I truly wish you the best, Aska. Take care of yourself, and I hope everything works out for you.
            </p>
